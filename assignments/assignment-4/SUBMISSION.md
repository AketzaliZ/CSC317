# Portfolio Styling Assignment Analysis

## Analysis
In all honesty the majority of the work I did for this is the css for making the calculator look as intended, i believe the professor provided us with most of the necessary rescources or code needed to just have us fill in any remaining gaps. The main challenge was figuring out the display box in the caluclator because i had thought everything would be in one display box and not actually in two input boxes.


##  Any additional features or improvements
Theme Switcher:
I added 2 extra themes for my css of the calculaor: theme1.css and theme2.css. along with the original calculator.css

## Acknoledgments
I used many of the hints and resources provided by the professors skeleton code and the help and suggestions given during the lectures preceeding this assignment.
