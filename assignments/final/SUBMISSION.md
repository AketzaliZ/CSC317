## Reflection on Group Travel Itinerary Project

This project helped me better understand how full-stack applications are structured using the MVC pattern. 
My main contribution was building the itinerary history feature, including the History model, historyController,delete function, and /history route.

One challenge I faced was figuring out what logic belonged in routes or controllers. With help from teammates and by reviewing the professorâ€™s example structure, I learned how to separate responsibilities properly. Overall, this project improved my understanding of backend concepts and gave me more confidence working in a team setting.
