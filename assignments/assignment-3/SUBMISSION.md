# Portfolio Styling Assignment Analysis

## Analysis
[Write a 250-500 word analysis comparing the different approaches]
For styles.css I immediatly focused on creating a cottagecore warm toned aesthetic.
I also started integrating grid-containers into all of my sections on the index.html and adjusting for nested containers for the baking section so that I could have it in a grid without using a table.
For ai-1.css I used chatgpt, and was very disappointed by the results, it was very minimal and did not provide the warm atmosphere I was expecting. It added the bare essentials in terms of organization but did not provide anything of significance to the page.
For ai-2.css I used a screenshot of a 'cute login page' tutorial and put it into Claude.ai. This one definetly delivered in terms of adding cute flowers around the page, provding a new font, and the responsiveness of the page was very good.

In the end I decided to merge the styles I had made myself as well as the ai-2.css. I had to keep most of my original structure but defintly used the sidebar customization from ai-2. Ai-2 also provided dotted bars to seperate information in my sections nicely, as well as a simple hover bee animation, and I kept some of the custom colors for fonts.

## Lessons Learned
I learned the most about keeping in mind the responsiveness of the webpage. 
In my original styles.css I had an animation of a bee that flew around the page based on pixels.
However when i tested the page on different screen sizes, the page size would change based on the bees location.
This would be very annoying to any users who would have a screen size that I did not accomodate for.

## Preferred Version
My prefered version is the hybrid one as it takes the aesthetic I was looking for in my original version 
while also cleaning up the organization of the sections in a way I had not thought of.
